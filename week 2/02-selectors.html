          <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
          <p>
            CSS selectors target and select the HTML elements you want to style.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, CSS selectors allow you to select multiple elements at
            once.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are useful when you want to apply the same styles to more than
            one HTML element, because you won't repeat yourself by writing the
            same lines of code for different elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS selectors are also useful when you want to make a change: you just
            make the change in one place, which saves you a lot of time.
          </p>

          <h2>Simple CSS Selectors</h2>
          <p>
            Selectors allow you to target specific parts of your document for
            styling purposes.
          </p>
          <p>Simple selectors directly select one or more elements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using the universal selector, *.</li>
            <li>Based on the name/type of the element.</li>
            <li>Based on the value of the element's class.</li>
            <li>Based on the value of the element's ID.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By learning how the most simple selectors work, you can understand how
            to use the more complex ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            The simple selectors will most often be the ones you will use the most
            and the ones you will be the most familiar with if you have some
            experience writing CSS code.

          <h2>Grouping CSS Selector</h2>
          <p>
            With the grouping selector, you can select and style more than one
            element at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            To use the grouping selector, use a comma, , to group and separate the
            different elements you want to select.
          </p>

        <div class="block-04">
          <h2>CSS Combinators</h2>
          <p>
            Combinators allow you to combine two elements based on the
            relationship between the elements and their location in the document.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, you can combine two simple selectors so that the
            relationship between those CSS selectors is explained. Combinators are
            a type of selector that specifies and describes the relationship
            between the two selectors.
          </p>
          <p>There are four types of combinators:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The descendant combinator.</li>
            <li>The child combinator.</li>
            <li>The general sibling combinator.</li>
            <li>The adjacent sibling combinator</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="block-05">
          <h2>Pseudo-Class Selectors</h2>
          <p>
            Pseudo-class selectors select elements that are in a specific state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pseudo-class selectors start with two colons, :, followed by a keyword
            reflecting the state of the specified element.
          </p>
          <p>Some examples of the state the element can be in are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The element is being hovered over by the mouse pointer.</li>
            <li>The element is the first of its type.</li>
            <li>The link has been visited before from that specific browser.</li>
            <li>
              The link has not been visited before from that specific browser.
            </li>
            <li>The checkbox/radio button has been checked.</li>
          </ul>
